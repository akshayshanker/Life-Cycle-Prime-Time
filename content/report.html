<p>+++ { "part": "abstract" }</p>
<p>The 'life cycle model' of optimal saving for retirement is familiar
to anyone who has taken an introductory economics class. When hiring a
financial advisor, people probably think of the advisor's job as being
just to tailor optimal life-cycle-model choices to their particular
circumstances. But academics and financial advisors know that the advice
about both saving and portfolio choice provided by standard academic
life-cycle models is deeply problematic -- for example, most such models
imply that retirees should plan to run their wealth down to zero or some
small amount and then (optimally!) live pension-check to pension-check
(at least approximately). This paper makes the case that recent
developments in the economics literature have finally given us the tools
we need to construct rigorous life cycle models whose advice is
sensible. We provide one example of a simple model that can solve a
number of problems by putting wealth in the utility function.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Franco Modigliani and Richard Brumberg (1954)<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
were the first to propose that it might be possible understand consumer
financial choices as reflecting optimal responses to the realities of
the path of income and of spending needs over the lifetime. An enormous
academic literature has followed their pioneering work, but it has
proven difficult to build rational optimizing models that give sensible
advice about both life cycle saving choices and about investment
decisions like how much of one's retirement savings should be invested
in the stock market.</p>
<p>But in the last few years, the academic literature has developed in
ways that offer the prospect that we may now finally be able to build
rigorous optimizing life cycle models whose advice is not obviously
wrong.</p>
<p>% Delete bullet</p>
<h3
id="computationuncertaintycomplexity">Computation/Uncertainty/Complexity</h3>
<p>The first such development is that the rapid advance of computational
capacity has made it possible to dispense with doubtful simplifications
and to construct credible answers to the question "what saving and
portfolio choices are mathematically optimal" in a real world whose key
complexities can finally be handled appropriately. In particular, the
incorporation of realistic descriptions of the uncertainties
decisionmakers face (about their own income, stock returns, interest
rates, health expenditures, mortality, and more) makes computation of
the optimal solution astonishingly difficult. Much harder, say, than the
computation of optimal trajectories for spacecraft; comparable perhaps
to the computational difficulty of figuring out how to drive a car
roughly as well as a human (another problem where adequate computational
solutions have only recently become available).</p>
<p>% Delete Bullet</p>
<h3 id="survey-data-on-expectations-and-preferences">Survey Data on
Expectations and Preferences</h3>
<p>A second academic development has been a new openness to the idea
that people's beliefs and preferences can be probed by <em>asking
them</em> about their beliefs and preferences.</p>
<p>In the context of motivations for saving, this leads us to want to
take seriously the answers to a survey question about their 'most
important' reason for saving that respondents to the Federal Reserve's
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">Survey of
Consumer Finances (SCF)</a> have been asked for many years. Among
retirees, one answer dominates the rest: 'Liquidity/The Future.' (See <a
href="#most-important-reason">the discussion below</a> for details).</p>
<p>The 'Liquidity' component of this answer suggests the possibility
that precautionary saving motives matter for many households --
highlighting the need for the computational advancements that now allow
us to properly model the mathematically optimal precautionary response
to beliefs about shocks.</p>
<p>%%% AL: Need to import Mateo's medical expense shocks (and need to
make them a default option in the life cycle models in HARK)</p>
<p>But a point worth emphasizing is that it is their <em>beliefs</em>
about shocks, and <em>preferences</em> toward risk that should determine
a person's behavior.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to calibrating such models has been for
economists to try to construct their own measurements of the necessary
inputs, and to assume that households believe whatever it is that the
economist has measured. But among the things newly being measured in
survey data are expectations of quantities that traditionally have been
calibrated. It turns out that economists' beliefs differ substantially
from the beliefs that many people really hold, and it seems reasonable
to suppose that the decisions people make reflect their actual beliefs
and preferences rather than whatever it is that economists think they
<em>should</em> believe and prefer.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>There is not yet a consensus about how these new findings should
modify our default calibrations for life cycle models. But some early
work suggests that taking these new calibrations into account could
resolve some of the problems that have traditionally beset the life
cycle modeling literature. For example, Mateo @velasquez-giraldoJMP has
shown that even college-educated people systematically have held beliefs
about stock market returns that are pessimistic compared to the returns
the market has historically delivered. He argues that this explains why,
historically, people have been less eager to invest in stocks than would
be predicted by models calibrated with economists' more optimistic
expectations. He argues that the portfolio investment behavior of
college-educated people over most of their lives is reasonably
consistent with rational decisionmaking (given their beliefs).
Concretely, many people think that investment in stocks is a lousy deal.
It's no mystery why such people do not invest.</p>
<h3 id="model-specification-and-estimation">Model Specification and
Estimation</h3>
<p>In the <a href="#Models">Models</a> section of the paper, we provide
a formal description of the mathematical and computational structure of
our optimizing models, beginning with the standard Life Cycle Portfolio
model (which calculates optimal saving and optimal portfolio shares over
the life cycle). We will find, in the <a
href="#Estimation">Estimation</a> section of the paper that the model
implies a rapid drawdown of wealth after retirement that we simply do
not see, confirming a longstanding problem with life cycle models (see,
e.g., @hurd1987savings).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (We will call this the 'drawdown
failure.') We next describe a model in which consumers have a bequest
motive, because the literature has explored whether such a motive could
explain the drawdown failure. But in the <a
href="#Estimation">Estimation</a> section we confirm the consensus in
the literature that the bequest motive does not seem to have much force
for the median household.</p>
<p>This leads us into more speculative territory. If what consumers care
most about is to hold wealth for 'Liquidity/The Future' but that wealth
is not explainable by a precautionary motive, a potential interpretation
is that consumers value the ownership of wealth in and of itself. After
fleshing out this idea a bit, we propose a final model that puts wealth
in the utility function directly -- and in the <a
href="#Estimation">Estimation</a> section we show that this final model
does a better job jointly matching the data on wealth profiles and
portfolio choice than either of the other models.</p>
<p>The main quantitative/mathematical result of this paper is to show
that a model with 'wealth in the utility function' can fit observed
post-retirement behavior of both wealth-holding and portfolio choice
better than the standard model (with or without a bequest motive).<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the broader point is that, recently, our modeling and conceptual
tools (including the concept that softer data like surveys should be
taken seriously) have advanced to the point where it is finally possible
to construct rational optimizing models of life cycle financial choice
that can serve as a credible justification for normative advice.</p>
<h1 id="models">Models</h1>
<p>The academic literature on life cycle modeling is extraordinarily
rich, and we cannot hope to do justice to it here. What we have done
instead is to construct a 'toy model' that captures some key points and
ideas. We think of this as a starting point for what we hope will be a
new literature that aims to integrate insights from many different kinds
of evidence into a plausible framework for thinking realistically about
life cycle financial choice.</p>
<p>One kind of further evidence that we view as vital to incorporate in
future models is the experience of financial advisors themselves in
interactions with their clients. We have been told,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> for
example, that advice that clients should run their wealth down to zero
then live pension-check to pension-check would be so unwelcome that a
financial advisor who provided that advice would be fired.</p>
<p>The kinds of models we are examining here are well suited to the task
of crafting systematic advice for clients like employers who need to
hire 401(k) plan providers. It is not hard to imagine that such clients
might be attracted to a 401(k) provider whose advice is justified by,
and can be explained using the logic of, a well-specified model of
optimal choice. That might be more persuasive than 'trust us, we know
what we are doing.'</p>
<p>For purposes like 401(k) or other pension plan design, the
optimization problem can be constrained to one that satisfies the legal
obligations the employers have to their employees. For example, the
employer's contract is with the employee, not with the employee's heirs.
The employee's duty is to craft a plan that is expected to permit the
employee to have adequate resources for their own expenditures during
retirement. These legal considerations effectively prohibit the advisor
from including a bequest motive in its optimization objective.<a

<h2 id="the-baseline-academic-models">The Baseline Academic Models</h2>
<h3 id="the-life-cycle-portfolio-lcp-model">The Life Cycle Portfolio
('LCP') Model</h3>
<p>We begin by describing the optimal consumption/saving problem over
the life cycle for a consumer with no access to a risky asset (like the
stock market) that earns a higher (expected) rate of return than the
safe asset. After we have finished describing the plain life cycle model
we will augment it to add optimal portfolio choice between safe and
risky assets.</p>
<p>In each period, a consumer's flow of utility depends on how much they
consume. We assume that the utility function is of the standard Constant
Relative Risk Aversion form: \begin{align} \uFunc(c) &amp; =
\frac{c^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} but of course the consumer is
smart enough to realize that preserving some resources for the future is
a good idea; this is why all wealth is not consumed immediately.</p>
<p>We follow a tradition dating back to @friedman1957 in assuming that a
consumer's financial circumstances depend chiefly on two variables.
<span class="math inline">$\pLvl_{t}$</span> is the consumer's permanent
income (roughly, the income they would normally expect to receive in the
absence of surprises like winning the lottery or a temporary layoff),
while <span class="math inline">$\mLvl_{t}$</span> is total market
resources (the sum of financial assets and current income -- think of
this as the pool of resources that can be immediately spent; 'money' in
the colloquial sense of 'how much money does grandma have?').</p>
<p>The 'value' of having a given amount of market resources <span
class="math inline">$\mLvl_{t}$</span> right now, and of knowing your
current permanent income level to be <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl_{t}$</span>, is determined by the utility you
will experience from consumption today, as well as the utility you
expect to experience in the future. Any future period matters to you
only to the extent that you expect to survive to that period.</p>
<p>In formal mathematical terms, the consumer's objective is to maximize
present discounted utility from consumption over a life cycle that ends
no later than date <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> (often
set to age 120):</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \pmb{\vFunc}<em>{t}(\mLvl</em>{t},\pLvl_{t}) =
\max_{{\cFunc}<em>{t}^{T}} ~
\uFunc(\cLvl</em>{t})+\Ex_{t}\left[\sum_{n=1}^{T-t}
\Alive_{t}^{t+n}{\DiscFac}^{n} \uFunc(\cLvl_{t+n}) \right]
\label{eq:lifecyclemax} \end{equation}</p>
<p>\begin{align} \ \Alive _{t}^{t+n} &amp; : \text{probability to
}\Alive\text{ive until age <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> + <em>n</em></span> given you are alive
at age <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>} \ &amp;
{~<del>}\bullet \text{<span class="math inline">$\Alive_{120}^{121} =
0.0$</span> says that a 120 year old has zero probability of living to
121} \ &amp; {</del>~}\bullet \text{<span
class="math inline">$\Alive_{80}^{90} = 0.3$</span> says that an 80 year
old has a 30 percent chance of reaching 90} % \ &amp; {~~~}\bullet
\text{<span class="math inline">$\Alive_{81}      = 0.9$</span> says
that an 80 year old has a 90 percent chance of reaching 91} \ {\DiscFac}
&amp; : \text{time discount factor (captures degree of present bias)}
\end{align}</p>
<p>We use standard calibrations for mortality by age from actuarial
mortality tables used by the Social Security administration. We set the
'pure' rate of time preference to <span
class="math inline"><em>β</em> = 1</span> because that means that the
optimal choice is to care exactly as much your future self as much as
your present self (conditional on surviving into the future).</p>
<p>One of the fundamental discoveries of the past 40 years or so is the
extent to which optimal choice is profoundly altered by the presence of
uncertainty. @friedman1957 proposed a simple formulation that remains an
excellent description of annual income shocks even today. Friedman said
that there are two components to income: A 'permanent' component that is
roughly what they would expect to earn in a 'normal' year (say, their
annual salary), and a 'transitory' component that reflects events like
unemployment spells or lottery winnings; these make a given year's
realized income deviate from its expected value.</p>
<p>To meld Friedmanian uncertainty with a Modlglianian life cycle, we
need one more definition, whose purpose is to capture the predictable
patterns that (noncapital) income follows over the lifetime (income
starts low, rises with age and experience, and falls at retirement to
the level of any regular pension payments): \begin{align}
\permGroFac_{t+1} &amp; : \text{typical life cycle permanent income
growth factor by age} \end{align}</p>
<p>The typical life cycle pattern is altered, in any particular
consumer's case, by 'permanent shocks' which we represent with the
variable <span class="math inline">$\permShk$</span>. At any given age,
permanent growth can deviate from the average experience of others of
the same age in either a positive direction (<span
class="math inline"><em>ψ</em> &gt; 1</span> would correspond to an
unexpected promotion or a switch to a higher-paying job) or a negative
direction (<span class="math inline"><em>ψ</em> &lt; 1</span> might be
the result of a failure to be promoted or a change to a lower paying
job).</p>
<p>This gives us the following description of the dynamics of permanent
income <span class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span>: \begin{align}
\pLvl_{t+1} &amp; = \pLvl_{t} \permGroFac_{t+1} \permShk_{t+1} \
\Ex_{t}[\pLvl_{t+1}] &amp; = \pLvl_{t} \permGroFac_{t+1} \end{align}
where the second line follows from the first because the expected value
of the permanent shock is <span
class="math inline">$\Ex_{t}[\permShk]=1$</span>.</p>
<p>The transitory shock to income has two modes. In unemployment spells,
the consumer earns no income; we assume that such spells occur with
probability <span class="math inline">$\pZero$</span>.If the consumer
remains employed, we will assume that the income shocks are lognormally
distributed:<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> \begin{align} \tranShkEmp_{s} =
&amp; \begin{cases} 0\phantom{/\pZero} &amp; \text{with probability
<span class="math inline">$\pZero&gt;0$</span>} \ \xi_{s}/\pZero &amp;
\text{with probability <span class="math inline">$(1-\pZero)$</span>}
\end{cases} \end{align}</p>
<p>It is conventional to assume that shocks to permanent income and to
the transitory income of the employed are lognormally distributed:
\begin{align} \log \permShk_{s} \thicksim
\mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\permShk, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\permShk, t]}^{2}) \
\log \xi_{s}\thicksim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\xi, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\xi,
t]}^{2}) \end{align} which, together with the other assumptions,
guarantee that the expected value of the transitory and of the permanent
shocks are both 1: <span
class="math inline">$\Ex_{t}[\permShk_{t+1}]=\Ex_{t}[\tranShk_{t+1}]=1$</span>.
(We use standard calibrations of both of these shock processes.)</p>
<p>Under the assumptions we have made about the structure of the utility
function (homotheticity) and budget constraint (linearity and geometric
returns), it is possible to recast the problem entirely in terms of
<em>ratios</em> of the model variables to permanent income <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span>. So, for example, italic <span
class="math inline">$\cNrm = \cLvl/\pLvl$</span> is the ratio of the
(boldface) level of consumption to the level of permanent income <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span> (see @BufferStockTheory for the
math).</p>
<p>Another way to make the problem easier to understand is to combine
several of the multiplicative terms into portmanteau variables. Defining
boldface <span class="math inline">$\pmb{\DiscFac}_{t+1}$</span> as
\begin{align} \pmb{\DiscFac}<em>{t+1} &amp; ={\beta} (\permShk</em>{t+1}
\permGroFac_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA} %\ \RNrm_{t+1} &amp; =
\left(\frac{\Rfree}{\permShk_{t+1}\permGroFac_{t+1}}\right)
\end{align}</p>
<p>%and simplifying the notation for the probability of survival to
<span class="math inline">$\Alive_{t+1} \equiv
\Alive_{t}^{t+1}$</span></p>
<p>Under the assumptions we have made, it turns out that the consumer's
problem can be expressed more simply by realizing that it boils down to
a 'now versus later' problem. All the consumer needs to know about the
future is summarized by the value they will expect as a consequence of
ending the current period with a certain ratio of assets to permanent
income, <span class="math inline">$\aNrm = \aLvl/\pLvl$</span>. We can
represent the value of ending the period with assets of <span
class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> using the Gothic variant of the
letter <span class="math inline">$\vFunc$</span>: \begin{align}
\mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(\aNrm</em>{t}) &amp; =
\Ex_{t}[\pmb{\DiscFac}<em>{t+1}\vFunc</em>{t+1}(\mNrm_{t+1})]
\end{align}</p>
<p>Finally we are ready to add portfolio choice to the problem. Suppose
the consumer can invest in a risky asset that earns rate of return <span
class="math inline">$\log \Risky \thicksim \mathcal{N}(\rfree + \eprem -
\sigma^{2}/2, \sigma^{2})$</span>. That is, we make the conventional
assumption that the risky asset is distributed lognormally with an
expected equity premium of <span
class="math inline">$\eprem$</span>.</p>
<p>The portfolio return the consumer earns will depend on the share of
their assets they invest in the risky versus the safe asset. Calling the
share <span class="math inline">𝜍</span>, the portfolio-weighted rate of
return will be \begin{align} \Rport_{t+1} &amp; = \Rfree +
(\Risky_{t+1}-\Rfree)\varsigma \end{align} and the consumer is assumed
to make the optimal choice of portfolio share: \begin{align}
\mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(a) &amp; = \max</em>{\varsigma}~~
\Ex_{t}[\pmb{\beta}<em>{t+1} \vFunc</em>{t+1}(\Rport_{t+1} a +
\theta_{t+1}) \end{align}</p>
<p>The consumer's objective in the consumption stage of the problem can
be expressed in Bellman form as: \begin{align}
{\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; = \max_{{\cNrm_{t}}} ~
\uFunc(\cNrm_{t})+\Alive_{t+1} \mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(\aNrm</em>{t}) \
&amp; \text{s.t.} &amp; \ \aNrm_{t} &amp; = {\mNrm}<em>{t}-\cNrm</em>{t}
% \ {\mNrm}<em>{t+1} &amp; = \aNrm</em>{t}\RNrm_{t+1} +
~\tranShkEmp_{t+1} \end{align}</p>

<p>We calibrate the model to include two kinds of uncertainty after
retirement.</p>
<p>First, we incorporate estimates from @velasquez-giraldoJMP of the
size of shocks to medical expenditures for retirees; a perfectly
rational reason not to run down your wealth, or not to run it down too
far, is a fear of large medical expenses that you want to be able to
meet. Such uncertainty has the potential to deter the drawdown of
wealth; see @ameriks2011joy for an argument that it is the principal
explanation for the 'drawdown failure.' While such effects are present
in our model, our model estimation results below will find that the
model still predicts much more drawdown of wealth than the data
show.</p>
<p>Second, we assume that there are 'ordinary' expenditure shocks in
retirement that are of similar magnitude to income shocks during working
life (following recent estimates from @flExpShocks). Again, in
principle, the presence of such shocks provides a precautionary motive
to draw down wealth more slowly.</p>
<h3 id="the-lcp-model-with-warm-glow-bequests">The LCP model with 'Warm
Glow' Bequests</h3>
<p>The LCP model sketched above assumes that the only reason to hold
wealth is to spend it later -- which means that eventually an age must
come at which the wealth starts being spent down. As the literature has
demonstrated, and as we will confirm below using data from SCF's from
1995 to 2022, the path of the median wealth ratio after retirement does
not look anything like what that model predicts.</p>
<p>Of course, the model can make no sense at all of the behavior of the
very rich. Bill Gates, for example, has chosen to allocate a large
portion of his lifetime wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation
rather than spending it on himself; and even with the pittance that
remains to him ($153 billion, according to <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-bill-gates-spends-fortune">Business
Insider</a>) he would need to spend about $22 million a day to <em>avoid
getting richer</em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> (In fact, he has pledged to give
away nearly all of his wealth before he dies).</p>
<p>But the model also fails for people of much more modest means. For a
substantial fraction of normal retirees, the drawdown phase seems never
to come (the 'drawdown failure' mentioned in the introduction).</p>
<p>From the mathematical point of view, it is clear that some other
motive for holding onto wealth must be added to the framework if it is
to explain these facts (never mind Bill Gates). A natural candidate is a
bequest motive: The idea that people take pleasure in the thought of
leaving something to their heirs.</p>
<p>This can be accommodated simply by adding another term to the sources
of utility: the value the consumer places on the bequest, which we will
denote as <span class="math inline">$\bqstNrm(\aNrm)$</span> (think of
this as the utility they experience from the thought of leaving an <span
class="math inline">$\bqstNrm$</span>state).</p>
<p>Defining the probability of passing away as the probability of not
<span class="math inline">$\Alive$</span>iving to the next period,
\begin{align} \cancel{\Alive} &amp; =(1-\Alive) \end{align} the flow of
utility that the consumer receives includes both their utility from
consumption <em>and</em> the pleasure they take from the thought that,
if they pass away before next period (which happens with probability
<span class="math inline">$\cancel{\Alive}$</span>), their assets will
pass to their heirs.</p>
<p>The consumer's new value function is therefore just \begin{align}
{\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; = \max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~
\overbrace{\uFunc(\cNrm_{t})}^{\text{present}}+\overbrace{\underbrace{\Alive_{t+1}\mathfrak{v}(\aNrm_{t})}<em>{\text{live}}
+
\underbrace{\cancel{\Alive}</em>{t+1}\bqstNrm({\aNrm}<em>{t})}</em>{\text{die}}
}^{\text{future}}. \end{align}</p>
<p>The literature has commonly used a `warm glow utility from bequests'
motive of the form: \begin{align} \bqstNrm(a) &amp; =
\alpha\frac{(a+\underline{a})^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} where the
<span class="math inline">$\CRRA$</span> coefficient is the same as in
the utility function for consumption (see, e.g., @deNardiBequest), and
the <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> coefficient controls the
importance of the bequest motive relative to the utility from
consumption.</p>
<h2 id="wealth-in-the-utility-function">Wealth in the Utility
Function</h2>
<p>Our estimation below will find little evidence that a bequest motive
of this kind is important for the median college-educated retiree. It
also seems unlikely to be important for much richer people, at least
according to the evidence from the historian Fredrick Cople
@jaherGilded's chronicle of the behavior of the richest Americans since
the Revolution. Jaher presents a feast of quotations articulating a host
of motivations for extreme wealth accumulation; but among their many
explanations of their behavior, almost none of the tycoons under study
mention anything resembling the bequest motive as formulated in the
standard academic life cycle literature. (Andrew Carnegie was most
explicit: 'I would rather leave my son a curse than the almighty
dollar.')<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This is one of those places where
economists' new openness to the idea of taking seriously what people say
about their motivations has bite. While it is not unreasonable to be
sceptical about taking such quotations at face value, @WhyDoTheRich
shows that essentially all of the motivations articulated (wealth brings
power; wealth allows philanthropy; wealth is a way of 'keeping score';
and more) can be captured in a mathematical formulation in which wealth
enters the utility function directly.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <a
href="https://doi.org/10.17016/8799">Survey of Consumer Finances</a> has
for many years asked respondents a question about their motivations for
saving.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> While respondents' answers are
fairly heterogeneous, the SCF has a suggested aggregation of the many
different answers into categories that correspond approximately to some
of the motivations that the academic literature has considered. The
category that best matches the 'bequest' motivation is 'Family' (which
includes 'to help the kids out' and 'to leave an estate' but also
includes saving for 'weddings and other cermonies' and 'to have
children/a family.')</p>
<p>An ambitious agenda would be to tabulate the answers to this survey
question for people at different ages and then to construct a model that
would imply the same age pattern of motivations as the data. For
example, one might find that for people who have just entered the labor
market (say, the 26-30 age group) the survey responses showed that
saving for 'retirement' was not a priority, while saving for 'purchases'
and 'liquidity' were important. In order for a model to be credible, its
implications would need to comport with the survey data.</p>
<p>Our aim here is to take a first step in that direction, by
constructing a model that is at least consistent with the responses of
retirees.</p>

<h3 id="table-most-important-reason-for-saving">Table: Most Important
Reason for Saving</h3>

<p>If bequests were a primary motivation for saving for most
(college-educated) people, it would be surprising for them to mention
this motivation so rarely.</p>
<p>Given these (and other) objections to the bequest motive, and given
the problems of the model without a bequest motive, it seems natural to
consider alternative modifications to the framework.</p>
<h3 id="technical-details-functional-form">Technical Details (functional
form)</h3>
<p>The most general way we economists have of incorporating people's
motivations into our models of behavior is simply to assume that the
decisionmaker directly values something -- in this case, wealth. The
next question is how best to incorporate the item in the utility
function to study any particular question. @WhyDoTheRich, for example,
proposed a utility function specifically designed to capture saving
behavior as wealth approached infinity, and accomplishing that goal
required some mathematical structure that delivered the desired results
but was unwieldy (and not obviously necessary for explaining the
behavior of the bottom 99 percent, whose wealth does not approach
infinity).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Money in the Utility Function</em></p>
<p>It turns out that there is a literature in macroeconomics, pioneered
by Miguel @sidrauski1967rational, that has long included 'money' in the
utility function of the representative agent in one form or another.</p>
<p>A well-known paper by <a href="doi:10.1086/261207"></a> proposed a
specific utility function designed to capture the stability of the ratio
of money to GDP, and Rotemberg along with James Poterba estimated this
model on U.S. data in <a href="doi:10.3386/w1796"></a>.</p>
<p>The structure of their utility function is \begin{align}
\uFunc(\cNrm,\lqdt) &amp; = \frac{\left( \cNrm^{1-\delta}\lqdt^{\delta}
\right)^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} where <span
class="math inline">$\lqdt$</span> captures the the <span
class="math inline">$\lqdt$</span>iquidity services provided by
money-holding.</p>
<p>To be clear, the aim of that literature was to explain the holding of
<span class="math inline">$\lqdt$</span> defined as dollar cash
holdings, to study questions like the 'velocity' of money and the role
of money supply and money demand in determining interest rates -- not to
explain saving behavior.</p>
<p><em>Wealth In the Utility Function: Cobb-Douglas Form</em></p>
<p>But for the question of how to incorporate wealth in the utility
function, <a href="doi:10.2139/ssrn.4693176"></a> proposed a
mathematically identical formulation, \begin{align} \uFunc(\cNrm,\aNrm)
&amp; = \frac{\left( \cNrm^{1-\delta}\aNrm^{\delta}
\right)^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} where <span
class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> takes the place of <span
class="math inline">$\lqdt$</span> in the Rotemberg-Poterba utility
function.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The Cobb-Douglas functional form
for the TRP utility function is commonly used in other contexts, but
does not seem to have been explored as a formulation for how to put a
direct wealth-holding motive in the utility function.</p>
<p>The upshot is that if we credit the proposition that the ownership of
wealth yields utility, then there is good precedent for the functional
form of <a href="doi:10.2139/ssrn.4693176"></a>. % AL: Add citation to
the 1998 paper you found Henceforth we will call this the
Tzitzouris-Rotemberg-Poterba or 'TRP' utility function.</p>
<p>It is a simple matter to solve the revised problem with wealth in the
utility function using the TRP utility specification. The revised value
function of the problem is: \begin{align}
{\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; = \max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~
\uFunc(\cNrm_{t}, \aNrm_{t})+\Alive_{t+1}\mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(a</em>{t})
\end{align}</p>
<p>We refrain from a description of the methods of solution here because
they are documented in the accompanying code archive which fully
reproduces all our results.</p>
<p>(We are open to the possibility that wealth in the utility function
is a reduced form for other motivations -- indeed, that was the thesis
of @WhyDoTheRich. In particular, the fact that in our SCF table above,
'Liquidity/The Future' is the most popular answer among retirees for the
most important reason to save might signal that the forms of uncertainty
that we can measure -- like the @Ameriks2020jpe calculations about
nursing home expense risks -- constitute only a fraction of the matters
retirees might worry about. Maintaining a buffer stock of wealth to
protect oneself against 'unknown unknowns' is possibly perfectly
rational, and also nearly impossible to calibrate in a quantitative
model in which we would need to have an accurate representation of
people's beliefs about the magnitude, frequency, and persistence of
'unknown unknowns.' But if you knew those answers, they would be, at
best, 'known unknowns.')</p>
<h1 id="estimation">Estimation</h1>
<h3 id="indirect-inference-described">Indirect Inference Described</h3>
<p>Even if you knew all the parameters of the model (the consumer's
coefficient of relative risk aversion, etc), solving an optimization
problem that includes the many real-world complications described above
(especially those due to uncertainty) is such a formidable problem that
it only became possible about 25 years ago (and solving the models took
days).</p>
<p>But of course we do not know the best values to choose for
unobservable parameters like relative risk aversion and time preference
rates. The solution to this problem that is becoming standard is the
method of 'indirect inference.' Essentially, this means specifying the
structure of your model except for the values of parameters that you
cannot measure well (like time preference and risk aversion), and asking
a numerical search algorithm to seek the values of those parameters that
lets the model fit the data as well as it is capable of doing. This
requires the computer to solve the problem perhaps thousands of times,
which is why indirect inference has only begun to come into its own
recently - as computer speeds have gotten fast enough to tackle the
problem.</p>
<h3 id="indirect-inference-implemented">Indirect Inference
Implemented</h3>
<p>We are particularly interested in finding the optimal post-retirement
choices, both for the rate of spending and for portfolio allocation
between safe and risky assets.</p>
<p><em>The Method of Simulated Moments</em></p>
<p>The method of simulated moments consists of finding the parameters
that make the model's simulated moments (statistics), like the median
wealth and the median portfolio share, match the corresponding empirical
facts as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Consider a real moment <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> where <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em> ∈ [1, <em>N</em>]</span> and the
corresponding simulated moment <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>,
where <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is the vector of
parameters that we are interested in estimating. By solving and
simulating our structural model with different <span
class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> parameters, we can calculate the
simulated moments <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>
for each parameter set. The method of simulated moments then consists of
finding the parameter set <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>
that minimizes the distance between the simulated moments and the real
moments. This is done by minimizing the following objective
function:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \omega_i [y_i -
\hat{y}_i(\theta) ] \right)^2 \end{equation}</p>
<p>where <span
class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the weight
of each moment in the objective function, representing the relative
importance of each moment in the estimation process. For example, we
might be more interested in matching the median wealth than the median
portfolio share, so we would assign a higher weight to the former.</p>
<p>For our exercise, we are interested in matching the median wealth to
income ratios throughout the life-cycle, and the median portfolio share
of risky assets after retirement. Because aggregate age data can be
noisy and subject to selection bias and measurement error, we will
aggregate the data into 5-year age bins to smooth out the noise and
reduce the impact of selection bias. Starting at age 25, we calculate
the median wealth to income ratio as follows: Wealth is defined as the
sum of all assets and liabilities, including financial assets, housing,
vehicles, and debt. For income, we use the sum of all wages, salaries,
social security, and retirement income, excluding capital gains and
other non-recurring income. We then calculate the wealth to income ratio
of every household in the age bin and remove households with an income
of zero. The median wealth to income ratio is calculated from the
remaining households. An important point is that in our structural model
we hard-code retirement at age 65, whereas in the data we observe
retirement at different ages, but predominantly between ages 60 and 70.
Therefore, we avoid the data for ages 60 to 70 to prevent any bias in
the estimation process, but keep the data for ages 70 and above to
capture the behavior of retirees. Similarly, we calculate the median
portfolio share of risky assets after retirement for ages 70 and above
given by @Aboagye2024.</p>
<p>Considering the selection of moments we have chosen, it is clear that
there is an inbalance between the wealth to income moments and the
portfolio share moments. There are more wealth to income moments than
portfolio share moments, (12 to 5), and the portfolio share moments lie
between 0 and 1, whereas the wealth to income ratios can be much larger.
To account for this, we set the weights to normalize the wealth to
income ratios by the highest ratio in the data, making them all lie
between 0 and 1, and set the weights for the portfolio share moments to
multiply by 12/5, so that the two sets of moments are equally weighted
in the estimation process. This ensures that our estimation process puts
even weight on the two sets of moments, despite the difference in scale
and number of moments.</p>
<p>Having pinned down the moments we are interested in matching and
their respective weights, we can now proceed to a discussion of
estimating the parameters of our vaious models. We use the
<code>Econ-ARK</code> project's <code>HARK</code> package to solve and
estimate the models, and <code>estimagic</code> (@Gabler2022) to perform
the estimation process. Our exercise consists of estimating 1 parameter
(the constant coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) parameter for
the Life Cycle Portfolio Choice Model) up to 3 parameters (CRRA, the
weight of the bequest motive, and the wealth-shifter of utility
parameter for the <code>LCP+WarmGlow</code> model), so we develop a
robust and efficient estimation process that can handle a varying number
of parameters.
<!-- % We call the merging of features from the `HARK` and `estimagic` packages `Estim-ARK`.--></p>
<p>Our estimation process is computationally expensive, requiring the
solving and simulation of the model given a parameter set many times.
Because our simulated moments indeed require simulation, our moment
generating functions <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>
have no analytical derivatives with respect to the parameters, so we
must rely on numerical differentiation and clever optimization
algorithms to find the optimal parameter set. We use the
<code>tranquilo</code> algorithm (@Gabler2024), which stands for
TrustRegion Adaptive Noise robust QuadratIc or Linear approximation
Optimizer, to find the optimal parameter set. The <code>tranquilo</code>
optimizer has many attractive features, such as being able to evaluate
the function in parallel and estimate even noisy objective functions
with many parameters, as well as being especially designed for least
squares problems, such as the MSM.</p>
<h3 id="indirect-inference-results">Indirect Inference Results</h3>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To thoughtful academics, it has long been disturbing that the
financial advice industry has paid so little attention to our hard work
in constructing and solving impressively sophisticated dynamic
stochastic optimization models of financial behavior. Those of us with a
bit of humility have always suspected that the failure has been on our
side: If all we could offer was models that produced risible advice like
'everyone should spend down their wealth to zero and live pension-check
to pension-check,' while financial analysts' real world experience told
them that such advice would get them fired, then it was reasonable to
disregard the academic literature.</p>
<p>The thesis of this paper, though, is that a confluence of factors has
now finally brought us to a point where state-of-the-art
mathematical/computational optimization models can provide advice that
makes sense, when the model assumptions are also disciplined by survey
data and the tacit knowledge of financial advisors.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>It would be a better world if financial advice could be justified as
reflecting the mathematically optimal solution to a well-defined
problem. Not only would academics have the satisfaction of knowing that
they had finally come close to fulfilling the vision of Modligliani and
Brumberg 70 years ago. Financial analysts could also sleep more soundly
in the knowledge that the advice they were giving were what many people
probably think it already is: The adaptation to the client's particular
circumstances of the advice that is the best that can be delivered by
the latest high-tech computational optimization tools.</p>
<p>The time seems ripe for a much closer collaboration between academia
and the financial industry in building this better world. This paper's
open-source code, built with the associated open-source <a
href="https://econ-ark.org">Econ-ARK</a> project's tools, would be a
good place to start.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

<li id="fn9"><p>As of 2024-05-15, the Fed Funds rate is 5.3 percent at
an annual rate. $153b <span class="math inline">×</span> 0.053/365 days
<span class="math inline">≈</span> $22 million. At the current inflation
rate of 3.4 percent, he would only have to spend a little over $8
million a day to run down his real wealth -- assuming the Fed Funds rate
is the highest rate of return he can earn.<a href="#fnref9"

was added to the maximizer's objective and with a coefficient of
relative risk aversion smaller than that for the utility from
consumption.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn13"><p>The question of whether <span
class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> or <span
class="math inline">$\mNrm$</span> should be in the utility function is
of little importance; here we prefer <span
class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> because assets after consumption are
immune to considerations of whether the time period is a year, a
quarter, a month, or a day.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn14"><p>Much more remains to be done to improve the models
further; for example, a question of great practical importance that is
now just at the edge of possibility of being computationally solved is
to calculate the implications of nonfinancial (principally, housing)
wealth for optimal financial choice. Because homeownership is such a
complex phenomenon, the academic literature is only now reaching the
point at which it may be possible to answer questions like "if I own a
house, how should I modify my spending and portfolio plans to take that
into account?" We do know the <em>direction</em> of the effect.
@kimballStandardRA shows that the addition of a new uncontrollable risk
reduces the optimal choice of exposure to controllable risks like the
stock market. But <em>by how much</em> one's stock exposure should be
reduced because of house-price risk can only be answererd by solving a
quantitatively plausible model.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back"
