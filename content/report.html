<p>+++ { "part": "abstract" }</p>
<p>The 'life cycle model' of optimal saving for retirement is familiar
to anyone who has taken an introductory economics class. When hiring a
financial advisor, it is plausible to imagine that people interpret
their advisor's job as being just to tailor optimal life-cycle-model
choices to their particular circumstances. But academics and financial
industry experts have long known that the advice about both saving and
portfolio choice provided by rigorous academic life-cycle models is
deeply problematic -- for example, such models imply that retirees
should plan to run their wealth down to zero (if they live long enough)
and then (optimally!) live the rest of their life pension-check to
pension-check. This paper makes the case that recent developments in the
economics literature, when combined with the kinds of feedback that
advisors get from their clients, can finally generate advice that is
both mathematically optimal and intuitively plausible.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Franco Modigliani and Richard Brumberg (1954)<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
were the first to propose that it might be possible understand consumer
financial choices as reflecting optimal responses to the realities of
the path of income and of spending needs over the lifetime. An enormous
academic literature has followed their pioneering work, but only very
recently have academic models of mathematically optimal behavior gotten
within spitting range of matching either the choices that real people
actually make, or the choices that financial advisors recommend to
them.</p>
<p>Three things have changed in the academic 'life cycle mathematical
optimization' literature that have all contributed to making the models'
predictions more plausible.</p>
<p>The first is that the rapid advance of computational capacity has
finally made it possible to construct credible answers to the question
"what saving and portfolio choices are actually optimal?" in a real
world that is extremely complex. In particular, the incorporation of
realistic descriptions of the uncertainties people face (about their own
incfome, stock returns, interest rates, health expenditures, mortality,
and more) makes computation of the optimal solution of the problem
astonishingly difficult. Much harder, say, than the computation of
optimal trajectories for spacecraft; comparable perhaps to the
computational difficulty of figuring out how to drive a car roughly as
well as a human (another problem where realistic computational (AI)
solutions have only recently become available).</p>
<p>A second development has been a new openness by academic economists
to the proposition that people's beliefs and preferences can be probed
by {asking them} about their beliefs and preferences. The traditional
academic approach had been to attribute to the optimal decisionmaker
beliefs based on economists' perceptions of the relevant facts (like the
rate of return, and riskiness, of the stock market). It turns out that
economists' beliefs differ substantially from the beliefs that most
people actually hold, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the
decisions people make reflect their own beliefs rather than the beliefs
of economists. Specifically with respect to stock returns, Mateo
Velaszquez-Giraldo (2024) <!-- AL: insert citation--> has shown that
even college-educated people systematically have expected stock market
returns worse than the returns the stock market has historically
delivered. He argues that this explains why, historically, people have
been less eager to invest in stocks than models calibrated with
economists' expectations say they should be.</p>
<p>Finally, economists have also become more receptive to new kinds of
evidence that go beyond the usual measurements of life cycle
trajectories of wealth and income from traditional sources like the
Federal Reserve's <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm"><strong>Survey
of Consumer Finances</strong></a> (SCF). One particularly relevant
example is feedback from the direct experience of financial advisors: It
seems that people react negatively to the idea of running their wealth
down to zero and then living pension-check to
pension-check.<!-- JT: Need something specific to cite --> The 'drawdown
failure' has typically been remedied, in the academic literature, by
adding a 'bequest motive' to the objectives of consumers. But it appears
that even childless people -- who presumably do not have much of a
bequest motive -- do not draw down their wealth in ways consistent with
the canonical life cycle model.
<!-- DE: Can you make a figure using the SCF? --></p>
<p>The model section of the paper examines a direct and simple solution,
which is to assume that people have an intrinsic desire to hold wealth,
distinct from the consequences those wealth holdings have for their
ability to consume in the future (as suggested in @carrollWhyDoTheRich).
The main substantive/mathematical point of this paper (in the "Model
Results" section) is to show that a model with 'wealth in the utility
function' explains observed post-retirement behavior of both
wealth-holding and portfolio choice better than the model with a
standard bequest motive (and much better than the model with neither a
bequest motive nor a direct utility from wealth).</p>
<!-- The thesis of this paper is twofold. The first is that when all of these elements are combined, a state-of-the-art mathematical optimization model can rationalize financial advisors' standard advice (in that their advice is consistent with the choices that would be made by a rational consumer with reasonable attitudes toward risk). -->

<p>This provides an attractive resolution to the awkward fact that the
financial industry's advice has, until now, had no rigorous underpinning
but tradition. Our resolution takes the satisfying form that perhaps
financial advisors had a better idea all along what constituted good
advice, and only now are the rigorous mathematical/computational models
able to explain why it was good advice.</p>

<p>We begin by describing the consumer's optimal consumption/saving
problem over the life cycle when they have no access to a risky asset
that earns a higher (expected) rate of return than the safe asset. After
we have finished describing the plain life cycle model we will add the
portfolio choice.</p>
<p>In each period, a consumer's flow of utility depends on how much they
consume. We assume that the utility function is of the standard Constant
Relative Risk Aversion form: \begin{align} \uFunc(c) &amp; =
\frac{c^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} but of course the consumer is
smart enough to realize that preserving some resources for the future is
a good idea; this is why all wealth is not consumed immediately.</p>
<p>We follow a tradition dating back to @friedman1957 in assuming that a
consumer's financial circumstances depend chiefly on two variables.
<span class="math inline">$\pLvl_{t}$</span> is the consumer's permanent
income (roughly, the income they would normally expect to receive in the
absence of surprises like winning the lottery or a temporary layoff),
while <span class="math inline">$\mLvl_{t}$</span> is total market
resources (the sum of financial assets and current income -- think of
this as the pool of resources that can be immediately spent; 'money' in
the colloquial sense of 'how much money does grandma have?').</p>
<p>The 'value' of having a given amount of market resources <span
class="math inline">$\mLvl_{t}$</span> right now, and of knowing your
current permanent income level to be <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl_{t}$</span>, is determined by the utility you
will experience from consumption today, as well as the utility you
expect to experience in the future. Any future period matters to you
only to the extent that you expect to survive to that period.</p>
<p>In formal mathematical terms, the consumer's objective is to maximize
present discounted utility from consumption over a life cycle that ends
no later than date <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> (often
set to age 120):</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \pmb{\vFunc}<em>{t}(\mLvl</em>{t},\pLvl_{t}) =
\max_{{\cFunc}<em>{t}^{T}} ~
\uFunc(\cLvl</em>{t})+\Ex_{t}\left[\sum_{n=1}^{T-t}
\Alive_{t}^{t+n}{\DiscFac}^{n} \uFunc(\cLvl_{t+n}) \right]
\label{eq:lifecyclemax} \end{equation}</p>
<p>\begin{align} \ \Alive _{t}^{t+n} &amp; : \text{probability to
}\Alive\text{ive until age <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> + <em>n</em></span> given you are alive

class="math inline">$\Alive_{80}^{90} = 0.3$</span> says that an 80 year
old has a 30 percent chance of reaching 90} % \ &amp; {~<del>}\bullet
\text{<span class="math inline">$\Alive_{81}      = 0.9$</span> says

&amp; : \text{time discount factor (captures degree of present bias)} \
&amp; {</del>~} \bullet \text{captures age-varying spending needs
(mainly, adjusts for family size)} % \ \beth &amp; :
\text{time-invariant 'pure' time preference factor} \ &amp; {~~~}
\bullet \text{rate of'present bias'; <span
class="math inline">ℶ = 1</span> corresponds to no present bias}
\end{align}</p>
<p>We use standard calibrations for mortality by age from actuarial
mortality tables used by the Social Security administration. We set the
'pure' rate of time preference to <span
class="math inline"><em>β</em> = 1</span> because that means that the
optimal choice is to care exactly as much your future self as much as
your present self (conditional on surviving into the future).</p>
<p>One of the fundamental discoveries of the past 40 years or so is the
extent to which optimal choice is profoundly altered by the presence of
uncertainty. @friedman1957 proposed a simple formulation that remains an
excellent description of annual income shocks even today. Friedman said
that there are two components to income: A 'permanent' component that is
roughly what a person would expect to earn in a 'normal' year (say,
their annual salary), and a 'transitory' component that reflects events
like unemployment spells or lottery winnings; these make a given year's
actual income deviate from its expected value.</p>
<p>To meld Friedmanian uncertainty with a Modlglianian life cycle, we
need one more definition, whose purpose is to capture the predictable
patterns that (noncapital) income follows over the lifetime (income
starts low, rises with age and experience, and falls at retirement to
the level of any regular pension payments): \begin{align}
\permGroFac_{t+1} &amp; : \text{typical life cycle permanent income
growth factor by age} \end{align}</p>
<p>The typical life cycle pattern is altered, in any particular
consumer's case, by 'permanent shocks' which we represent with the
variable <span class="math inline">$\permShk$</span>. At any given age,
actual permanent growth can deviate from the average experience of
others of the same age in either a positive direction (<span
class="math inline"><em>ψ</em> &gt; 1</span> would correspond to an
unexpected promotion or a switch to a higher-paying job) or a negative
direction (<span class="math inline"><em>ψ</em> &lt; 1</span> might be
the result of a failure to be promoted or a change to a lower paying
job).</p>
<p>This gives us the following description of the dynamics of permanent
income <span class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span>: \begin{align}
\pLvl_{t+1} &amp; = \pLvl_{t} \permGroFac_{t+1} \permShk_{t+1} \
\Ex_{t}[\pLvl_{t+1}] &amp; = \pLvl_{t} \permGroFac_{t+1} \end{align}
where the second line follows from the first because the expected value
of the permanent shock is <span
class="math inline">$\Ex_{t}[\permShk]=1$</span>.</p>
<p>The transitory shock to income has two modes. In unemployment spells,
the consumer earns no income; we assume that such spells occur with
probability <span class="math inline">$\pZero$</span>.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If
the consumer remains employed, we will assume that the income shocks are
lognormally distributed:</p>
<p>\begin{align} \tranShkEmp_{s} = &amp; \begin{cases}
0\phantom{/\pZero} &amp; \text{with probability <span
class="math inline">$\pZero&gt;0$</span>} \ \xi_{s}/\pZero &amp;
\text{with probability <span class="math inline">$(1-\pZero)$</span>}
\end{cases} \end{align}</p>
<p>It is conventional to assume that shocks to permanent income and to
the transitory income of the employed are lognormally distributed:
\begin{align} \log \permShk_{s} \thicksim
\mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\permShk, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\permShk, t]}^{2}) \
\log \xi_{s}\thicksim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\xi, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\xi,
t]}^{2}) \end{align} which, together with the other assumptions,
guarantee that the expected value of the transitory and of the permanent
shocks are both 1: <span
class="math inline">$\Ex_{t}[\permShk_{t+1}]=\Ex_{t}[\tranShk_{t+1}]=1$</span>.
(We use standard calibrations of both of these shock processes.)</p>
<p>Under the assumptions we have made about the structure of the utility
function (homotheticity) and budget constraint (linearity and geometric
returns), it is possible to recast the problem entirely in terms of
<em>ratios</em> of the model variables to permanent income <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span>. So, for example, italic <span
class="math inline">$\cNrm = \cLvl/\pLvl$</span> is the ratio of the
(boldface) level of consumption to the level of permanent income <span
class="math inline">$\pLvl$</span> (see @BufferStockTheory for the
math).</p>
<p>Another way to make the problem easier to understand is to combine
several of the multiplicative terms into portmanteau variables. Defining
boldface <span class="math inline">$\pmb{\DiscFac}_{t+1}$</span> as
\begin{align} \pmb{\DiscFac}<em>{t+1} &amp; ={\beta} (\permShk</em>{t+1}
\permGroFac_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA} %\ \RNrm_{t+1} &amp; =
\left(\frac{\Rfree}{\permShk_{t+1}\permGroFac_{t+1}}\right)
\end{align}</p>
<p>%and simplifying the notation for the probability of survival to
<span class="math inline">$\Alive_{t+1} \equiv
\Alive_{t}^{t+1}$</span></p>
<p>Under the assumptions we have made, it turns out that the consumer's
problem can be expressed more simply by realizing that it boils down to
a 'now versus later' problem. All the consumer really needs to know
about the future is summarized by the value they will expect as a
consequence of ending the current period with a certain ratio of assets
to permanent income, <span class="math inline">$\aNrm =
\aLvl/\pLvl$</span>. We can represent the value of ending the period
with assets of <span class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> using the Gothic
variant of the letter <span class="math inline">$\vFunc$</span>:
\begin{align} \mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(\aNrm</em>{t}) &amp; =
\Ex_{t}[\pmb{\DiscFac}<em>{t+1}\vFunc</em>{t+1}(\mNrm_{t+1})]
\end{align}</p>
<p>Finally we are ready to add portfolio choice to the problem. Suppose
the consumer can invest in a risky asset that earns rate of return <span
class="math inline">$\log \Risky \thicksim \mathcal{N}(\rfree + \eprem -
\sigma^{2}/2, \sigma^{2})$</span>. That is, we make the conventional
assumption that the risky asset is distributed lognormally with an
expected equity premium of <span
class="math inline">$\eprem$</span>.</p>
<p>The portfolio return the consumer earns will depend on the share of
their assets they invest in the risky versus the safe asset. Calling the
share <span class="math inline">𝜍</span>, the portfolio-weighted rate of
return will be \begin{align} \Rport_{t+1} &amp; = \Rfree +
(\Risky_{t+1}-\Rfree)\varsigma \end{align} and the consumer is assumed
to make the optimal choice of portfolio share: \begin{align}
\mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(a) &amp; = \max</em>{\varsigma}
\Ex_{t}[\pmb{\beta}<em>{t+1} \vFunc</em>{t+1}(\Rport_{t+1} a +
\theta_{t+1}) \end{align}</p>
<p>The consumer's objective in the consumption stage of the problem can
now be expressed in Bellman form as: \begin{align}
{\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; = \max_{{\cNrm_{t}}} ~
\uFunc(\cNrm_{t})+\Alive_{t+1} \mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(\aNrm</em>{t}) \
&amp; \text{s.t.} &amp; \ \aNrm_{t} &amp; = {\mNrm}<em>{t}-\cNrm</em>{t}
% \ {\mNrm}<em>{t+1} &amp; = \aNrm</em>{t}\RNrm_{t+1} +
~\tranShkEmp_{t+1} \end{align}</p>

<h3 id="the-lcp-model-with-a-warm-glow-bequest">The LCP model with a
'Warm Glow' Bequest</h3>
<p>The LCP model sketched above assumes that the only reason to hold
wealth is to spend it later -- which means that eventually an age must
come at which the consumer begins to spend their wealth down. As the
literature cited above has demonstrated, and as we will confirm below
using data, the path of median wealth after retirement does not look
anything like what that model predicts -- looking at data through age
90, median wealth is constant or rising.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>A rough estimate might be that this prediction matches the saving
behavior of a third of retired households (predominantly those with less
education and lower lifetime permanent incomes) -- including the
prediction that retired people will tend to run down their wealth to
zero and then live pension-check to pension-check. (The model misses
badly in the portfolio choice dimension -- it predicts that what little
wealth these people have will be substantially invested in the stock
market, while the evidence indicates that low-wealth people have very
little stock market investment. But the model's error in this dimension
can be plausibly explained by supposing that there are modest costs to
participation in the stock market that make the higher return not worth
the cost of participation).</p>
<p>Of course, the model can make no sense at all of the behavior of the
very rich. Bill Gates, for example, has chosen to allocate a large
portion of his lifetime wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation;
and even with his so-far-uncontributed wealth, he shows no sign of
drawing it down remaining wealth over his remaining lifetime.</p>
<p>But for a substantial fraction of retirees, the 'drawdown' phase
seems never to come (or at best the drawdown is modest). This is the
'drawdown failure' mentioned in the introduction.</p>
<!--% AL: Could you update my calculation from the WhyDoTheRichSave paper of how much he would need to spend each day to accomplish this?-->

<!--
% explain why lit has added this:
% - people don't seem to draw down their wealth as they age

% AL: If you could make a figure from the SCF, or find one in a published paper, that would be great
-->

<p>From the mathematical point of view, it is clear that some other
motive for holding onto wealth must be added to the framework if it is
to explain these facts. A natural candidate is a bequest motive: The
idea that people take pleasure in the thought of leaving something to
their heirs.</p>
<p>This can be accommodated very simply by adding another term to the
sources of utility: the value the consumer places on the bequest, which
we will denote as <span class="math inline">$\ell(\aNrm)$</span> (think
of this as they utility they experience from the thought of leaving a
<span class="math inline">ℓ</span>egacy).</p>
<p>Defining the probability of passing away as the probability of not
<span class="math inline">$\Alive$</span>iving to the next period,
\begin{align} \cancel{\Alive} &amp; =(1-\Alive) \end{align} the flow of
utility that the consumer receives now includes both their utility from
consumption <em>and</em> the pleasure they take from the thought that,
if they pass away before next period (which happens with probability
<span class="math inline">$\cancel{\Alive}$</span>), their assets will
pass to their heirs.</p>
<p>The consumer's new value function is therefore just \begin{align}
{\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; = \max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~
\overbrace{\uFunc(\cNrm_{t})}^{\text{present}}+\overbrace{\underbrace{\Alive_{t+1}\mathfrak{v}(\aNrm_{t})}<em>{\text{live}}
+
\underbrace{\cancel{\Alive}</em>{t+1}\ell({\aNrm}<em>{t})}</em>{\text{die}}
}^{\text{future}}. \end{align}</p>
<p>The literature has commonly used a `warm glow utility from bequests'
motive of the form: \begin{align} \ell(a) &amp; =
\alpha\frac{(a+\underline{a})^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} (see,
e.g., <!-- AL add citation to DeNardi (2004) --></p>
<p>The proposition that the pattern of wealth drawdown after retirement
can be explained by a bequest motive has not gone without criticism. An
old objection, in a literature dating to the 1980s, found that, if
anything, childless elderly people (who presumably would not have a
bequest motive) save more than those with children. <!-- Menchik? -->
Another objection is that, when asked about their main motivations for
saving, retirees generally do not mention bequest motivations
prominently
<!-- AL: Let's ask DE to construct a literature map and see if he can either find evidence for this or just make the requisite tabulation using the SCF --></p>
<h2 id="wealth-in-the-utility-function">Wealth in the Utility
Function</h2>
<p>%<em>Why Do the Rich Save So Much?</em></p>
<p>The historian Fredrick Cople @jaherGilded's chronicle of the behavior
of the richest Americans since the 1800s is striking in two ways. His
book contains a feast of quotations, over a long time span, from the
richest Americans articulating a host of motivations for wealth
accumulation; and very few of these mention anything resembling the
bequest motive as formulated in the academic life cycle literature. This
is one of those places where economists' new openness to the idea
seriously what people say about their motivations has bite. While it is
not unreasonable to be sceptical about taking such quotations at face
value, @WhyDoTheRich shows that essentially all of the motivations
(wealth brings power; wealth allows philanthropy; wealth is a way of
'keeping score'; and more) can be captured in a mathematical formulation
in which wealth enters the utility function directly.</p>
<p>This is consonant with the views of Max Weber (1905), who argued that
the 'spirit of capitalism' was a value system in which it was
intrinsically virtuous to accumulate wealth. And it is also in line with
survey data from the modern <strong>Surveys of Consumer
Finances</strong>, which find that only 5 percent of respondents, and
only 4 percent of respondents in the richest 1 percent, put 'leaving an
inheritance' among <strong>the top 5</strong> reasons for saving
(@WhyDoTheRich).</p>
<p>% [^fiduciary]?</p>
<p>Given these (and other) objections to the bequest motive, and given
the problems of a model without a bequest motive, it seems natural to
consider alternative modifications to the Modigliani-Brumberg assumption
that the only purpose of holding wealth is to enable future
consumption.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-subsection-about">What is this subsection
about?</h3>
<p>% For our purposes, the takeaway from that it presents a context in
which the neither the Modgliani-Brumberg assumption that wealth is held
only to finance future consumption, nor the standard augmentation of
that model to accommodate the desire to leave a bequest to heirs, seems
to suffice for explaining behavior with respect to wealth.</p>
<p>The most general way we economists have of incorporating motivations
into our models of behavior is simply to assume that the decisionmaker
directly values something -- in this case, wealth. The next question is
how best to structure the utility function to study any particular
question. @WhyDoTheRich, for example, proposed a utility function
specifically designed to capture behavior as wealth approached infinity,
and accomplishing that goal required some mathematical structure that
delivered the desired results but was unwieldy (and not obviously
necessary for explaining the behavior of the bottom 99 percent, whose
wealth does not approach infinity).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Money in the Utility Function</em></p>
<p>In fact, it turns out that there is a literature in macroeconomics,
pioneered by Miguel @sidrauski1967rational, that has long included
'money' in the utility function of the representative agent in one form
or another.</p>
<p>A well-known paper by <a href="doi:10.1086/261207"></a> proposed a
specific utility function designed to capture the stability of the ratio
of money to GDP, and Rotemberg along with James Poterba estimated this
model on U.S. data in <a href="doi:10.3386/w1796"></a>.</p>
<p>The structure of their utility function is \begin{align}
\uFunc(\cNrm,\ell) &amp; = \frac{\left( \cNrm^{1-\delta}\ell^{\delta}
\right)^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} where <span
class="math inline">ℓ</span> captures the the liquidity services
provided by money-holding.</p>
<p>To be clear, the aim of that literature was to explain the holding of
dollar cash balances to study questions like the 'velocity' of money and
the role of money supply and money demand in determining interest rates
-- not to explain saving behavior.</p>
<p>But for the question of how to incorporate wealth in the utility
function, <a href="doi:10.2139/ssrn.4693176"></a> proposed a
mathematically identical formulation, \begin{align} \uFunc(\cNrm,\aNrm)
&amp; = \frac{\left( \cNrm^{1-\delta}\aNrm^{\delta}
\right)^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA} \end{align} where <span
class="math inline">$\aNrm$</span> takes the place of <span
class="math inline">ℓ</span> in the Rotemberg-Poterba utility
function.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"

class="math inline"><sup>,</sup></span><a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The upshot is that if we credit the proposition that the ownership of
assets yields utility, then there is good precedent for the functional
form of utility proposed by <a href="doi:10.2139/ssrn.4693176"></a> in
the work of Rotemberg and Poterba. Henceforth we will call this
Cobb-Douglas formulation of the utility provided by asset holdings the
Tzitzouris-Rotemberg-Poterba or 'TRP' utility function.</p>
<p>% postulated a utility of wealth that implied that such ownership was
a 'luxury good' in the sense that the more lifetime resources a person
had available, the larger was the proportion that would be devoted to
the pleasures (whatever they may be) of wealth ownership <em>per
se</em>. The model was constructed specifically to capture the fact that
at the extreme upper reaches of the wealth distribution it seems likely
that the amount of ordinary consumption expenditure the agent could
accomplish during the span of a human lifetime becomes small.</p>
<p>It is a simple matter to solve the revised problem with wealth in the
utility function using the TRP utility specification. The revised value
function of the problem is:</p>
<p>%A simple extension to the stochastic Life Cycle model is to include
wealth in the utility function directly. <a
href="doi:10.3386/w6549"></a> argues that models in which the only
driver of wealth accumulation is consumption smoothing are not
consistent with the saving behavior of the wealthiest households.
Instead, they propose a model in which households derive utility from
their level of wealth itself or they derive a flow of services from
political power and social status, calling it the 'Capitalist Spirit'
model. In turn, we can add this feature to the LCIM model by adding a
utility function with consumption and wealth. We call this the Wealth in
the Utility Function Incomplete Markets (WUFIM) model.</p>
<p>\begin{align} {\vFunc}<em>{t}({\mNrm}</em>{t}) &amp; =
\max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~ \uFunc(\cNrm_{t},
\aNrm_{t})+\Alive_{t+1}\mathfrak{v}<em>{t}(a</em>{t}) % \ &amp;

{\mNrm}<em>{t+1} &amp; = \aNrm</em>{t}\RNrm_{t+1}+ ~\tranShkEmp_{t+1}
\end{align}</p>
<p>The methods of solution are essentially the same as those for the
model with a bequest.</p>
<p>% <strong>Separable Utility</strong> <a href="doi:10.3386/w6549"></a>
presents extensive empirical and informal evidence for a LCIM model with
wealth in the utility function. Specifically, the paper uses a utility
that is separable in consumption and wealth:</p>
<h1 id="estimation-and-calibration">Estimation and Calibration</h1>
<h3 id="indirect-inference-described">Indirect Inference Described</h3>
<p>Even if you knew all the parameters of the model (the consumer's
coefficient of relative risk aversion; their time preference factor),
solving an optimization problem that includes the many real-world
complications described above (especially those due to uncertainty) is
such a formidable problem that it only became possible about 25 years
ago, and solving the models took days.</p>
<p>But of course we do not know the best values to choose for
unobservable parameters like relative risk aversion and time preference
rates. The solution to this problem that is now becoming standard is to
the method of 'indirect inference.' Essentially, this means specifying
the structure of your model except for the values of parameters that you
cannot measure well (like time preference and risk aversion), and asking
a numerical search algorithm to seek the values of parameters that makes
the model fit the data as well as it is capable of doing. This requires
the computer to solve the problem perhaps thousands of times, which is
why indirect inference is only coming into its own now - when computer
speeds have gotten fast enough to tackle the problem.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in finding the optimal post-retirement
choices, both for the rate of spending and for portfolio allocation

<h4 id="a-tricky-issue">A Tricky Issue</h4>
<p>In addition to the advances in computation already mentioned, one
other ingredient is essential to our model's success in producing advice
that matches people's behavior: Our use of data about people's actual
beliefs.</p>
<p>This is crucial because of a longstanding tension in the
literature.</p>
<p>When economists studying households' consumption/saving behavior
estimate the relative risk aversion and time preference parameters that
are consistent with household saving choices, they have long found that
the model can fit the data with a moderate degree of risk aversion<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and a moderate degree of present
bias.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> However, when models of portfolio
choice are estimated in an attempt to match actual portfolio choice,
they typically require extreme values of relative risk aversion<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and require implausible time
discounting.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Two facts have recently emerged that, together, make the model much
more consistent with the data.</p>
<p>The first is new data from the New York Fed's <em>Survey of Consumer
Expectations</em> about people's perceptions of the amount of risk they
face.</p>
<!-- 
It turns out that economists' calibrations of the degree of noncapital income uncertainty greatly exceeds the amount of uncertainty that people report perceiving (see WangTao JMP). This is a case where the economists may well be wrong. Our method of computing uncertainty basically assumes that whenever income changes for reasons we economists cannot explain, the change is the consequence of a random shock (which rational people would need to take into account when planning how much to save). But income can change in ways that are perfectly predictable to the consumer based on information we economists do not see. For example, a person might take a long break from work for a long-planned round-the-world trip, which would look like an unexplainable random shock to the economist. 

Whether the economists are right or the survey respondents are right: As noted above, the decisions people make presumably depend upon their own perceptions and not whatever beliefs economists might impute to them. If people perceive much less risk than we economists thought, and yet still behave in ways that show considerable sensitivity to (small) amounts of risk, that suggests that they are more risk averse than we had thought.
-->

<p>The second new fact is that most people seem to believe that the
stock market has both lower (log) returns and higher uncertainty than
exhibited in the historical time series statistics that economists have
traditionally used to impute beliefs to them. Their pessimism (relative
to historical experience) provides a natural explanation for why so many
people invest so little in the stock market: They think it is a bad
deal. <!-- AL: add cite to Mateo's JMP --></p>
<p>Our model's ability to fit people's actual behavior (for both
portfolio choice and consumption/saving decisions) better than models
that do not take actual people's actual beliefs into account is further
evidence that the academic approach has been on the right track in
moving toward measuring beliefs (and using those measurements).</p>
<p>A tricky question remains. If, as economists who are deeply versed in
the historical experience of market returns, we feel that the actual
beliefs people hold are unduly pessimistic, what advice should we give
people about how to invest? Financial advisors, of course, face the same
question.</p>
<p>A helpful analogy might ease our concerns on this score. In very many
domains of life, people put their trust in experts who know the relevant
facts to make decisions. For example, even someone building their own
new home, who feels quite capable of deciding questions about the
orientation of the house or the size of the garage is expected to comply
with the regulations of the electrical wiring code of their house. They
are not expected to master the complexity behind the question of how
wiring should be done to trade off safety and convenience in provision
of electricity to the different parts of the house. The extent to which
people feel the need to consult financial advisors (or to abide by
pension and 401(k) rules devised by such advisors), the natural
interpretation would seem to be that they think of questions like how
much to save for retirement or how much to invest in stocks versus bonds
as questions that should be answered by experts. Indeed, if financial
advisors did not know any relevant facts that the household did know,
and did not have any expertise about what to do with those facts to make
a prudent saving and investment plan, why would the (enormous) financial
consulting industry exist at all?</p>
<p>Where that leaves us (or at least leaves me) is with the view that
the role of financial advisors (and the role of rigorous
mathematical/computational life cycle modeling) is to provide people
with the answers that they would themselves choose if they had the
requisite knowledge and experience.</p>
<h4 id="the-method-of-simulated-moments">The Method of Simulated
Moments</h4>
<p>The method of simulated moments consists of finding the parameters
that make the model's simulated moments, like the median wealth and the
median portfolio share, match the corresponding empirical moments as
closely as possible. Consider a real moment <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> where <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em> ∈ [1, <em>N</em>]</span> and the
corresponding simulated moment <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>,
where <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is the vector of
parameters that we are interested in estimating. By solving and
simulating our structural model with different <span
class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> parameters, we can calculate the
simulated moments <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>
for each parameter set. The method of simulated moments then consists of
finding the parameter set <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>
that minimizes the distance between the simulated moments and the real
moments. This is done by minimizing the following objective
function:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \omega_i [y_i -
\hat{y}_i(\theta) ] \right)^2 \end{equation}</p>
<p>where <span
class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the weight
of each moment in the objective function, representing the relative
importance of each moment in the estimation process. For example, we
might be more interested in matching the median wealth than the median
portfolio share, so we would assign a higher weight to the former.</p>
<p>For our exercise, we are interested in matching the median wealth to
income ratios throughout the life-cycle, and the median portfolio share
of risky assets after retirement. Because aggregate age data can be
noisy and subject to selection bias and measurement error, we will
aggregate the data into 5-year age bins to smooth out the noise and
reduce the impact of selection bias. Starting at age 25, we calculate
the median wealth to income ratio as follows: Wealth is defined as the
sum of all assets and liabilities, including financial assets, housing,
vehicles, and debt. For income, we use the sum of all wages, salaries,
social security, and retirement income, excluding capital gains and
other non-recurring income. We then calculate the wealth to income ratio
of every household in the age bin and remove households with an income
of zero. The median wealth to income ratio is calculated from the
remaining households. An important point is that in our structural model
we hard-code retirement at age 65, whereas in the data we observe
retirement at different ages, but predominantly between ages 60 and 70.
Therefore, we avoid the data for ages 60 to 70 to prevent any bias in
the estimation process, but keep the data for ages 70 and above to
capture the behavior of retirees. Similarly, we calculate the median
portfolio share of risky assets after retirement for ages 70 and above
given by @Aboagye2024.</p>
<p>Considering the selection of moments we have chosen, it is clear that
there is an inbalance between the wealth to income moments and the
portfolio share moments. There are more wealth to income moments than
portfolio share moments, (12 to 5), and the portfolio share moments lie
between 0 and 1, whereas the wealth to income ratios can be much larger.
To account for this, we set the weights to normalize the wealth to
income ratios by the highest ratio in the data, making them all lie
between 0 and 1, and set the weights for the portfolio share moments to
multiply by 12/5, so that the two sets of moments are equally weighted
in the estimation process. This ensures that our estimation process puts
even weight on the two sets of moments, despite the difference in scale
and number of moments.</p>
<p>Having pinned down the moments we are interested in matching and
their respective weights, we can now proceed to a discussion of
estimating the parameters of our vaious models. We use the
<code>Econ-ARK</code> project's <code>HARK</code> package to solve and
estimate the models, and <code>estimagic</code> (@Gabler2022) to perform
the estimation process. Our exercise consists of estimating 1 parameter
(the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) parameter for the Simple
Portfolio Choice Model) up to 3 parameters (CRRA, the wealth-share of
utility parameter, and the wealth-shifter of utility parameter for the
<code>TRP</code> model), so we develop a robust and efficient estimation
process that can handle a varying number of parameters. We call the
merging of features from the <code>HARK</code> and
<code>estimagic</code> packages <code>Estim-ARK</code>.</p>
<p>Our estimation process is computationally expensive, requiring the
solving and simulation of the model given a parameter set many times.
Because our simulated moments indeed require simulation, our moment
generating functions <span
class="math inline"><em>ŷ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>θ</em>)</span>
have no analytical derivatives with respect to the parameters, so we
must rely on numerical differentiation and clever optimization
algorithms to find the optimal parameter set. We use the
<code>tranquilo</code> algorithm (@Gabler2024), which stands for
TrustRegion Adaptive Noise robust QUadratIc or Linear approximation
Optimizer, to find the optimal parameter set. The <code>tranquilo</code>
optimizer has many attractive features, such as being able to evaluate
the function in parallel and estimate even noisy objective functions
with many parameters, as well as being especially designed for least
squares problems, such as the MSM.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To thoughtful academics, it has long been disturbing that financial
analysts have paid so little attention to our hard work in constructing
and solving impressively sophisticated dynamic stochastic life cycle
models. Those of us with sufficient humility have always suspected that
the failure has been on our side: If all we could offer was models that
produced risible advice like 'everyone should spend down their wealth to
zero and live pension-check to pension-check' and financial analysts'
real world experience told them that such advice would not be embraced,
either by individual consumers or by the fiduciary agents responsible
for systematic planning (such as officers at corporate 401(k) plans),
then it was a reasonable choice to disregard the academic
literature.</p>
<p>The thesis of this paper, though, is that a confluence of factors
(including the ability to make our models much more realistic) has now
finally brought us to a point where state-of-the-art
mathematical/computational optimization models can provide advice that
makes sense. Much more remains to be done to improve the models further;
for example, a question of great practical importance that is now just
at the edge of possibility of being solved is to incorporate the
implications of housing wealth for optimal choice. Because homeownership
is such a complex phenomenon, the academic literature is only now
reaching the point at which it may be possible to answer questions like
"if I own a house, how should I optimally modify my spending and
portfolio plans to take that into account?"</p>
<p>In a better world than the one we currently live in, not only would
academics have the satisfaction of knowing that they had finally come
close to fulfilling the vision of Modligliani and Brumberg 60 years ago.
Financial analysts could also sleep more soundly in the knowledge that
the advice they were giving could be closer to what many people probably
think it already is: The adaptation to the client's particular
circumstances of the advice that is the best that can be delivered by
the latest high-tech computational optimization tools.</p>
<p>The time seems ripe for a much closer collaboration between academia
and the financial industry in building this better world.</p>
